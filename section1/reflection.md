1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I already do/ know most of these, but a few are significant and bear remembering:
- Growth mindset: power can't be overstated, req's practice
- Teaching: I've never **really** known something until I've been able to teach it
- Breaks: I'm not great at this one. I either don't take breaks or my breaks go way too long.
