## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  1. *Believing you can improve skills with effort and practice. Not new to me, but a good reminder and hard for me to remember. It's easy to say "I'm just not a [math/coding/smart] person." But anyone can be any of those and more, given enough effort and practice.*
  2. *Mistakes are essential to learning. Also not new, also not easy for me to keep in mind. Cliche, but "move fast and break things" is applicable here. Don't feel bad for making mistakes in the learning process - they help make you better!*


1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
*I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by improving within my zone of proximal development, focussing on my processes, and many other non-emotional/ non-self esteem aspects. I could definitely improve negative self talk, taking breaks when things get a little hard, believing improvement is possible with effort and practice, and remembering that I don't have to be a "math person" or "left-brained" or "inherently smart".*

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
*A hash is a list of key/value pairs. It differs from an array in that it contains specifically key/value pairs, whereas an array contains a simple list.*

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {'cat food' => 10, 'dog food' => 25, 'cat toys' => 9, 'dog toys' => 11}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys`
`states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
*A hash could be used to store metadata about an email or social media post. Hashes could be considered 'better' than arrays because they are capable of storing more information in a specific and concise way than arrays.*

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
*None that I can't google! ;)*
